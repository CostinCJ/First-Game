# Roll-a-ball
This is a simple 3D game created in Unity. The player controls a blue sphere that rolls around a bounded area, collecting yellow cubes while avoiding obstacles and the red enemy. The game features a minimalist design with intuitive mechanics, and the "Count" system keeps track of the collected items. The addition of colored barriers adds a layer of challenge and creativity to the environment.
