# Roll-a-ball
This is a simple 3D game created in Unity. The player controls a blue sphere that rolls around a bounded area, collecting yellow cubes while avoiding obstacles and the red enemy. The game features a minimalist design with intuitive mechanics, and the "Count" system keeps track of the collected items. The addition of colored barriers adds a layer of challenge and creativity to the environment.

This game marks the beginning of an exciting new learning journey for me, as I have started exploring Unity with C# to pursue my dream of becoming a game developer. While it may be a small step, I am confident that, through continuous learning and dedication, I will achieve this goal.
